      <p>
        A lone Dwarf stands between an orc raiding party and a small fishing town. 
        He focuses and the rune on his hand glows. 
        A monstrous beast with large claws and teeth appear in front of the orcs. 
        They think it's an illusion until it begins to rip them to pieces. 
        The beast approaches the Dwarf and they nod before the Dwarf waves his hand and dismisses his partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Elf woman blows out the candle and lays down to sleep. 
        A few hours later an assassin sneaks in through the unlocked window. 
        Seemed easy enough, until a sword pierced his chest and he began to bleed onto the floor. 
        A small fight later and the assassin lays dead in a puddle of blood. As the sun comes up the woman wakes up. 
        The sun makes the floor shine, 'Its never looked cleaner' She thinks to herself. 
        She looks up and sees her knight in shining armor still standing guard. She smiles and knows she'll always be safe.

      <h3>Class Overview</h3>
      <p>
        While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters from the farthest reaches of the
        planes, none are more skilled at it than the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a
        close bond with one particular outsider, known as an Eidolon, who gains power as the summoner becomes
        more proficient at his summoning. Over time, the two become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of
        the same soul. But this power comes with a price: the summoner's spells and abilities are limited due to
        his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the nature of his Eidolon.

    <h2><span id="Class_Features">Class Features</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="Eidolon">Eidolon</span></h3>
    <p>
      A Summoner begins to play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an Eidolon.
      The Eidolon forms a link with the Summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature.
      An Eidolon has the same alignment as the Summoner that calls it unless specified otherwise and can speak
      all of his languages. Eidolons act after the summoner's turn but the summoner must use their action to
      order their summon to attack, if they have extra attack they instead sacrifice and attack if they take
      the attack action... Eidilons are summoned creatures but they are not sent back to their home plane
      until reduced to zero hit points. In addition, due to its tie to its Summoner, an Eidolon can touch and
      attack creatures warded by effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Summoner can summon his Eidolon using an action The Eidolon is summoned with a number of hit points
      equal to its hit point total the last time the Eidolon was dismissed, unless the Summoner has taken a
      short or long rest, in which case the Eidolon is at its maximum hit points. If an Eidolon is reduced to
      0 hit points, it is immediately banished, and cannot be summoned again until the Summoner has finished a
      long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eidolon takes a form shaped by the Summoner's desires or life struggles. At first level the Eidolon
      has 10 hit points, plus its constitution modifier, and gains a number of hit points each time the
      Summoner levels up equal to 1d10 plus its constitution modifier. The Eidolon shares any special senses
      (such as Darkvision) that the Summoner has, and uses the Summoners proficiency bonus. The summoner may
      also sacrifice hit points equal to the damage done to the Eidolon, but not the other way around, in
      order to prevent damage done to the Eidolon. In addition, each Eidolon receives a pool of evolution
      points, based on the Summoner's class level, that can be used to give the Eidolon different abilities
      and powers. Whenever the Summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are
      set until he gains another level of Summoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eidolon's physical appearance is up to the Summoner, but it always appears as some sort of
      fantastical creature. The Eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on
      the Summoner as long as the Eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it
      cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as <i>Alter Self</i> or <i>Polymorph</i>
      (although <i>Invisibility</i> does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).
    </p>
    <p>
      When you first take a level in Summoner, you assign your Eidolon ability scores as if creating a
      character using point buy or rolling (see PHB). You may increase any ability score of an Eidolon
      whenever you gain the ability score improvement class feature from the Summoner class. In effect, the
      Eidolon gets the "Ability Score Improvement" feature at the same levels as its Summoner, with the same
      restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Eidolon is proficient with any simple weapons if it starts with the bipedal base form, they lack
      proficiency with armor but can still wear it with barding, unless they have a perfectly humanoid form.
      However, an Eidolon can wear any other item that is not armor (such as rings or amulets.)
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Summoner.27s_Bond:">Summoner's Bond:</span></h3>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of the summoning, Eidolons are resistant to attempts to control the Eidolon's
      movement, mind or attacking abilities. This gives the Eidolon advantage on rolls against fear and charm
      effects, and any effects that can be shrugged off by self harming actions will also be ended when the
      Eidolon is commanded to harm their summoner.
      Additionally, the Eidolon and summoner can telepathically communicate to each other as long as they're
      in the same plane of existence.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Spellcasting:">Spellcasting:</span></h3>
    <p>
      At second level the summoner has regained his ability to cast spells after temporarily losing it as a
      side effect of the bonding ritual between him and his Eidolon (Although you do not lose your
      spellcasting-abilities when you multiclass into this class). As a summoner your spell casting ability is
      Charisma and you cast spells from the summoner spell list. The DCs for your spells is 8+ your
      proficiency bonus+ your Charisma modifier, while your spell attack bonus is your proficiency bonus+ your
      Charisma modifier. You know a number of spells according to the summoner spells known column on the
      summoner leveling table. Whenever a summoner gains a spell through this feature they may replace one of
      their previously chosen spells for another of a level that they can cast. The summoner also knows a
      number of cantrips as shown on the cantrips known column of the summoner table.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Bond_Senses:">Bond Senses:</span></h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as an action, share the senses of his Eidolon, hearing, seeing,
      smelling, tasting, and touching everything the Eidolon does. While doing so, the summoner is completely
      blind, deaf, unfeeling and cannot taste until they end the effect. There is no range to this effect, but
      the Eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a bonus
      action.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Archetype">Archetype</span></h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, the summoner selects an archetype, between Broodmaster, Eidolist, Divisionist or
      Synergist. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Lifelink">Lifelink</span></h3>
    <p>At level 3, a summoner's life becomes linked to his Eidolon's. Whenever either the Eidolon or the
      Summoner takes damage, as a reaction either may sacrifice hit points up to the amount of the damage
      taken, and not in excess of their current hit points. If they do, they prevent damage equal to the
      number of hit points lost this way. The Eidolon may only choose to sacrifice hit points if the summoner
      is damaged, and the summoner may only sacrifice hit points if the Eidolon is damaged. Neither can
      sacrifice hit points for the other if they are below half of their hit point maximum.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Ability_Score_Improvement">Ability Score Improvement</span></h3>
    <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability
      score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
      can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Maker's_Call:"></span><span id="Maker.27s_Call:">Maker's Call:</span></h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, as an action, a summoner can call his Eidolon to his side. This functions as the spell
      <b>Dimension Door</b>. When used, the Eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible
      if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the Eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The
      summoner can use this ability once per day per summon at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for
      every four levels beyond 6th.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Second_Summon">Second Summon</span></h3>
    <p>
      Additionally, at the 6th level the summoner has a close bond with his Eidolon. This allows him to
      create a new bond with another Eidolon, this new summon is treated the same as his first (This option is
      not available to the Broodmaster Archetype). Both summons can be called at the same time, but it must
      take a separate action on the summoners part to summon both Eidolon. This summon can be ordered in the
      same fashion as the first with both verbal and mental communications. This Eidolon is also granted all
      of the evolution points granted to the first Eidolon up till now. (this effect extends to Eidolonist,
      but the Eidolonist cannot have their summon out when either the original or this summon are around.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Aspect">Aspect</span></h3>
    <p>
      Starting at the 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 3 points from his Eidolon's evolution pool to
      add evolution to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the Eidolon could not possess, and he must
      be able to meet the requirements as well. Any points spent in this way are taken from the Eidolon's
      evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the Eidolon). The summoner can change the
      evolution he receives from these points any time he can change the Eidolon's evolution.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Shield_Ally">Shield Ally</span></h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 14th level, whenever a friendly creature is adjacent to the Eidolon, the Eidolon may
      impose disadvantage on the attacking creature
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Evolutionist">Evolutionist</span></h3>
    <p>Beginning at 18th level, you may alter your Eidolon's evolutions after a long rest.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Twin_Eidolon">Twin Eidolon</span></h3>
    <p>At 20th level, a summoner and his Eidolon share a true connection. As an action, the summoner can
      assume the shape of his Eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his Eidolon. He can choose to have
      any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, drop to the ground or be worn if it makes
      sense for him to wear it in the form of his Eidolon. Items with continuous effects continue to function
      while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses access to their class levels while in this form, as well
      as his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the
      abilities granted by his Eidolon's evolutions, additionally the summoner gains the difference in health
      from his Eidolon (if it has more) as temporary hit points. To exit this form, the summoner must use a
      separate action, otherwise he can stay this way for as long as they want.
    </p>
    <h2><span id="Eidolons">Eidolons</span></h2>
    <p>An Eidolon's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and by the choices made using its
      evolution pool. Each Eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these base statistics. Eidolons are
      "monstrosities" for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Eidolon_Skills">Eidolon Skills</span>
    </h3>
    <p>Eidolons are proficient in whatever skills the summoner is proficient in.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Eidolon_Multi-attack">Eidolon Multi-attack</span></h3>
    <p>On an Eidolon's turn, if it chooses to do an attack action with natural weapons, it can do a
      multi-attack with all of these. However, there's a limit to how many attacks an Eidolon can do in this
      short time, the limit increases with levels.
    </p>
    <p>They can do 2 natural attacks in their multi-attack at first level, 3 at 5th level, 4 at 9th level, 5
      at 13th level and finally 6 at 17th level.
    </p>
    <p>Know that the Eidolon must possess the number of natural attack evolution to do the amount of attacks
      you want it to do.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="Eidolon_Base_Forms">Eidolon Base Forms</span></h3>
    <p>Each Eidolon has one of five base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and
      saving throw proficiencies. These base forms also note any free evolutions that base form possesses. The
      bonuses from these free evolutions are already factored into the starting statistics.

    <h2><span id="Evolutions">Evolutions</span></h2>
    <p>Each Eidolon receives a number of evolution points that reflects the highly adaptable nature that
      Eidolon's possess. They can be spent to give the Eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades.
      These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are
      otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the Eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of
      a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the Eidolon additional natural
      attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the
      points must be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can
      only be selected once.
    </p>
    <h3><span id="0-Point_Evolutions">0-Point Evolutions</span></h3>
    <p><b>Eidolon Type:</b>
      Choose one “monster type” from the following options; beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental,
      fey, fiend, plant, or undead. The Eidolon now belongs to that type. An Eidolon without this evolution is
      treated as being a monstrosity.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <h4><span id="Type">Type</span></h4>
    <p>After selecting its base form, choose a type from the following list. Your Eidolon gains the general
      appearance of a creature of the chosen type, as well as a bonus skill proficiency, and is treated as a
      creature of that type for spells and other effects. <br />
      <b>Celestial</b>: Proficiency with Persuasion and +1 Charisma. <br />
      <b>Dragon</b>: Proficiency with Arcana and +1 Constitution. <br />

    <h3><span id="1-Point_Evolutions">1-Point Evolutions</span></h3>
    <p>The following evolutions cost 1 point from the Eidolon's evolution pool.
    </p>
    <p><b>Bite:</b> An Eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack. The bite deals 1d6
      + str mod points of piercing damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). An Eidolon cannot make more bite
      attacks in a turn than the number of bite evolutions it has.
    </p>
    <p><b>Claws:</b> An Eidolon has a pair of vicious claws at the end of its limbs, giving it two claws. The
      claws deal 1d4+str or dex mod points of slashing damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). A claw attack can
      me made as a bonus action when the attack action is made, dealing 1d4 points of damage with no ability
      modifier. The Eidolon must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This evolution can only be
      applied to the limbs (legs) evolution once. This evolution can be selected more than once, but the
      Eidolon must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution. An Eidolon cannot make more claw attacks in
      a turn than twice the number of claw evolutions it has.

      ability to fly. The Eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. For 2 additional evolution
      points, the Eidolon flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, and no longer relies on physical means
      to fly. The Eidolon's fly speed can be increased by spending additional evolution points, gaining a
      20-foot increase to fly speed for each additional point spent.
    </p>
    <p><b>Gore:</b> An Eidolon grows a number of horns on its head, giving it a gore attack. This attack is a

    </p>
    <p><b>Head:</b> An Eidolon grows an additional head. The Eidolon does not gain any additional natural
      attacks for the additional head, but the additional head does allow the Eidolon to take other evolutions
      that add an additional attack to a head (such as a bite or breath weapon). This evolution can be
      selected more than once.
    </p>
    <p><b>Improved Natural Armor:</b> An Eidolon's hide becomes more resistant to damage (through the
      development of thick fur, rigid scales, bony plates, or some other adaptation) making it's armor class
      equal 14+ Dex. They also become resistant to the extremes of temperature.
    </p>
    <p><b>Size Control:</b> An Eidolon that has learned to control their size in order to survive. They are
      able to manipulate their body to either grow or shrink (only applicable to Eidolon that are large or

      can be made into legs, complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the Eidolon's base speed by 10
      feet. Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The Eidolon does not gain any
      additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add
      additional attacks (such as claws or a slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield weapons, if the
      Eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be selected more than once.
    </p>
    <p><b>Poison:</b> An Eidolon secretes toxic venom, gaining a poison attack. Pick one bite or sting attack.

      type
    </p>
    <p><b>Trample:</b> An Eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability.
      As a full-round action, the Eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least its size or one size
      smaller. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the Eidolon does not need to make a check, it
      merely has to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d8
      if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the Eidolon's Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can
      make attacks of opportunity at a –4 penalty. If a target forgoes the attack of opportunity, it can make
      a Dex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 8+ the Eidolon's Strength modifier+ the Eidolon's
      proficiency bonus. A trampling Eidolon can only deal trampling damage to a creature once per round. This

      Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8+ the Eidolon's Strength or Dexterity modifier + the Eidolon's
      proficiency modifier. If the target fails, they are knocked prone. This ability only works on creatures
      of a size equal to or smaller than the Eidolon. The Eidolon must possess the bite, tail slap, slam, or
      tentacles evolutions to select this evolution.
    </p>
    <p><b>Weapon Training:</b> An Eidolon learns to use a weapon, gaining Simple Weapon Proficiency as a bonus

    </p>
    <p><b>Blindsense:</b> An Eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense out to a range of
      30 feet. This ability allows the Eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it cannot see
      without having to make a Perception check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the
      Eidolon. Visibility still affects the Eidolon's movement and creatures it cannot see still have
      advantage on attacks against it.
    </p>
    <p><b>Burrow:</b> An Eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The
      Eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed. It can use this speed to move through dirt,
      clay, sand, and earth. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface.
    </p>
    <p><b>Deep Sight:</b> Magic infuses your Eidolon's eyes, allowing it to see perfectly in magical darkness
      as far as it's darkvision allows it to.
    </p>
    <p><b>Exotic Resistance:</b> An Eidolon's form takes on a resiliency to one of the less common energy
      types. Pick one energy type (radiant, necrotic, force, psychic). The Eidolon gains resistance to that
      energy type. At level 20, this resistance becomes an immunity to the given energy type. This evolution
      can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an Eidolon selects this evolution,
      it applies to a different energy type.
    </p>
    <p><b>Frightful Presence:</b> An Eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence
      ability. The Eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or
      attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the Eidolon must make a Wisdom save or become frightened for 1
      minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
      itself on a success. The DC of this save is equal to 8+ the Eidolon's Charisma mod+ the Eidolon's
      proficiency modifier.
    </p>
    <p><b>Healing Touch:</b> Your Eidolon can heal creatures with a touch. It gains a pool of healing points
      equal to 3 times the Summoner's class level. It can expend any number of points from this pool to heal a
      creature it touches. additionally you can spend more points on this evolution, for every additional
      evolution point spent you increase the multiplier used with the summoner's class level. This pool
      refreshes after a long rest.
    </p>
    <p><b>Siphon Health:</b> An Eidolon can siphon its own health to heal another creature. As a standard
      action, the Eidolon can sacrifice up to 2 hit points per summoner level and then touch the target
      creature, thereby healing the creature for the amount sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Shrink:</b> Big things come in small packages, as your Eidolon decreases in size. Your Eidolon
      becomes one size category smaller, to a minimum of diminutive. Each size category smaller than Small it
      becomes, it deals 1d4 less damage with its natural attacks (minimum 1 damage). This evolution can be
      taken multiple times. Each time this evolution is taken, increase your Eidolon's Dexterity score by 2,
      Strength decreases by 2, and the maximum for Dexterity is increased by 2. The first time this evolution
      is taken, your Eidolon gains advantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The
      second this evolution is taken, your Eidolon gains advantage on all Dexterity checks, including saving
      throws. In addition, as long as your Eidolon is tiny, all attack rolls against it have disadvantage, and
      it is no longer able to wield manufactured weapons if it was able to do so before. This evolution
      provides no further bonus beyond ability score increases if taken more than twice.
    </p>
    <p><b>Swallow Whole:</b> An Eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its
      foes. If the Eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab
      evolution), it can attempt to swallow the creature with a second opposed grapple check. The creature can
      only be up to one size category smaller than the Eidolon. Swallowed creatures take damage equal to the
      Eidolon's bite damage each round plus 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A swallowed creature keeps the
      grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light slashing or piercing weapon. The
      amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the Eidolon's total hit points. The Eidolon's AC
      against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way
      out, the Eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature
      can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the Eidolon's
      mouth, where it can attempt to escape or be swallowed again. The Eidolon must possess the grab
      evolution, tied to a bite attack, to take this evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Venom:</b> Your Eidolon can inject enemies with a wicked venom. Select one bite or stinger. Once
      chosen, this cannot be changed. When it makes a successful attack, the target must make a Constitution
      save equal to 8 + the Eidolon's Constitution modifier + the Eidolon's proficiency bonus. On a failed
      save, the target is paralyzed for 1 round. This effect can only be used once per turn.

          An Eidolon learns to cast dimension door as a spell-like ability once per
          long rest. The caster level for this evolution is equal to the summoner’s caster level. The save DC for
          this spell is 8 + the Eidolon’s proficiency bonus + the Eidolon’s Charisma modifier. The Eidolon must
          have a Charisma score of at least 14 to take this evolution. Taking this evolution more than once adds
          one cast per long rest.

          An Eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The Eidolon gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4
          bonus to Constitution, to a maximum of 22, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor,and disadvantage on
          Stealth skill checks. If the Eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains 10-foot reach. Any reach
          evolutions the Eidolon possesses are added to this total. The Eidolon must be Medium to take this
          evolution.
          <br>
          <br>
          If 6 evolution points are spent, the Eidolon instead becomes Huge. The Eidolon gains a +8 bonus to
          Strength, a +8 bonus to Constitution, to a maximum of 24, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor, 10-foot
          reach, and disadvantage on Stealth checks. If the Eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases
          to 15 feet (10 feet for all other base forms). Any reach evolutions the Eidolon possesses are added to
          this total. It deals an extra 2d4 damage with its natural attacks. These bonuses and penalties replace,

      <h3>5-Point Evolutions</h3>
      <span>The following evolutions cost 5 points from the Eidolon's evolution pool.</span>


      <p>
        <b>Energy Attacks:</b> An Eidolon's attacks become charged with energy. Pick one natural attack type
        and one energy type: acid, cold, lightning, fire, thunder, radiant, or necrotic. Whenever the selected
        attack hits, the target takes 2d8 points of damage of the selected type.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sacrifice:</b> The Eidolon becomes explosive at its death. As an action you can sacrifice your
        Eidolon, you must have line of sight. Once sacrificed the Eidolon releases a sphere of force centered on
        it. Those caught can attempt a Dex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 8+ the Eidolon's
        Constitution modifier+ the Eidolon's proficiency bonus, damage according to the Eidolons hp total, size,
        and summoner level.
        Hp Total: Full to Quarter Hp - 1/4 damage, &lt;Quarter to 2 Hp - Full damage.
        Size: Tiny-5 foot square, Small-10 foot sphere, Medium-20 foot sphere, Large-30 foot sphere, Huge-40
        foot sphere.
        Damage&#160;: 1d6 of force damage per level of summoner. As a reaction you can detonate you Eidolon if
        reduced to 0 Hp, it deals 1/2 damage, 1 Hp - X2 damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Share Spell:</b> Spells cast by the summoner on the summoner effect the Eidolon as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Evolutionary:</b> An Eidolon that has become the epitome of evolution. Grants an additional 2
        evolution points per level and +1 to survival checks. (This is not stackable)

    <h3><span id="Eidolist">Eidolist</span></h3>
    <p>
      You prefer to focus on improving your Eidolon above all else, giving it significant increases in its
      abilities.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="Enduring_Eidolon">Enduring Eidolon</span></h4>
    <p>
      Beginning at 3rd level when you select this archetype, your Eidolon gains 6 additional hit points, and
      gains two additional hit points whenever you gain a level in summoner.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="Strong_Bond">Strong Bond</span></h4>
    <p>Beginning at 7th level, an Eidolist can summon one of two Eidolons as an action. The second Eidolon's
      build is of your choosing. Only one Eidolon can be summoned at a time. You also only need a long rest
      before you can change the characteristics of one of the Eidolon's builds. You can also temporarily
      dismiss any summon as an action, putting them into a pocket dimension similar to find familiar
    </p>
    <h4><span id="Evolutionist_2">Evolutionist</span></h4>
    <p>
      At 11th level an Eidolist adds 10 points to the evolution pool of their Eidolon
    </p>

    <h4><span id="Merge_Forms">Merge Forms</span></h4>
    <p>
      At 15th level, as an action, an Eidolist can touch his Eidolon and the two can merge forms. This
      transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected
      from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the
      summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the Eidolon (although durations continue to
      expire).
    </p>
    <p>
      The summoner can cast spells while inside the Eidolon by taking control of the Eidolon for the duration
      of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even
      though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the Eidolon's actions while
      merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Eidolist can end this effect at any time as a bonus action. The Eidolist emerges in a square
      adjacent to the Eidolon if able. If the Eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is
      merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of force damage, and is stunned
      for 1 minute.
