    <h2> 1. Why Not Just Be A Bear? </h2>
    <p>
      Anybody can be a warrior, but how many people fight as a bear? 
      The point of this character outline is to acquire the combat wildshape ability
      from the Druid class and focus on maintaining it's viability as the game progresses.

      <br><br>

      This character build is a <b>Multiclass Druid (15) / Barbarian (3) / Paladin (2)</b>.
      <br> It is very powerful mechanically while also being very cool to play.
      
      <br><br>

      It uses the fact that Racial and Class features persist while you are using wildshape to it's
      own advantage. Primarily the Barbarian's "Rage" mechanic to let you stay in the fight as a Bear
      and REALLY take advantage of the hit points "gained" from wildshaping. Secondarily the Paladin's 
      "Smite" mechanic to allow you to stay combat-relevant while fighting as a Bear at higher levels.
    </p>

  <div id="Race">
    <h2> 2. Race </h2>
    <p>
      Any race works for this build, as Str/Dex/Con get replaced with your wildshape's scores.
      That being said, a few races do have some more notable bonuses that work with wildshape.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Half-Orc:</b> Relentless Endurance can preserve wildshape through massive attacks.</li>
      <li><b>Variant Human:</b> Starting with a feat like can really boost combat effectiveness.</li>
      <li><b>Forest Gnome:</b> Advantage vs. Magical Int/Wis/Cha saving throws.</li>
      <li><b>Wood Elf:</b> +5 feet of movement is preserved while wildshaped.</li>
    </ul>

  <div id="Level_Progression">
    <h2> 3. Level Progression </h2>
    <p>Although there are a number of ways to do this, you'll find the most success with this base build by
      doing the following:
    </p>
  
    
    <ul>
      <li> Level 1-2: Druid -- Aim to acquire "Circle of the Moon" ASAP for Bear Form wildshape. </li>
      <li> Level 3: Barbarian -- Getting Rage ASAP will help with survivability and damage. </li>
      <li> Level 4-5: Paladin -- Divine Smite for relevance in damage as levels increase.  </li>
      <li> Level 6-7: Barbarian -- Bear Totem Primal Path for increased tankiness. </li>
      <li> Level 8-20: Druid -- Bigger spells, better wildshape forms, everything you need. </li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1-2 Druid: Your going for the Circle of the Moon. Immediately you can change into a bear, a
        powerful combat form. You're also a spellcaster.</li>
      <li>Level 3 Barbarian: Rage is an increadible damage and tankiness steroid. Having 2 rages and 2
        wildforms almost feels like they were meant to be used together! Your unarmored defense can also
        occassionally give you a higher AC than the wildshape would normally have, which is nice.</li>
      <li>Level 4-19 Druid: One thing to always remember is that the strongest beast you can turn into is
        equal to 1/3 your <i>Druid level</i>. That means you need to always increase it to obtain stronger and
        stronger forms. You'll remain a powerful caster as well for your team, and at level 19 you can even
        start casting spells in your beast form.</li>
      <li>Level 20 Barbarian: This extra level in barbarian is optional. However, getting easy advantage on
        your attacks while transformed is an amazing option to have. Danger Sense can also be nice since most
        versions of this have a pretty high dexterity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Barbarian 3/Druid 17 - This small adjustement unlocks the barbarian subclass - Totem warrior. It
      doubles the health of your wildshapes while your raging, something that is arguably stronger than
      anything you can get from that extra level in druid. To do this, you'll start with 2 levels in druid,
      then 3 levels in Barbarian, then max Druid afterwards.
    </p>

  <h2>
    4. Action Economy (& Combos)
  </h2>
  <p>When using this combo, it is important to keep the action economy in mind. Rage requires a bonus action
    and Wildshape requires either your action or bonus action. This creates three three ways to use this
    combo, each of which have benefits and drawbacks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Combo 1 - Instant Primal</b>: this completely consumes your first turn to use an Action to
      wildshape and your bonus action to rage. The main benefit is that you immediately gain the benefit of
      both effects, ready to take and deal damage for the rest of the fight. There are two downsides though.
      First, if the battle is short you will be standing around for a turn instead of fighting, kinda
      disappointing. Second, your gambling you’ll take damage in the first round since your rage might end
      early as you have no action to attack and the enemy might avoid you rather than fight you.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Combo 2 - Two Turn Windup</b>: This focuses on letting you attack each turn and using your bonus
      actions early on to Wildshape the rage the next turn. The benefit is you have no idle turns and deal a
      good portion of damage. The first risk is that you don’t have rage protecting you turn 1, meaning your
      wildshape will take a lot more damage than normal and be closer to breaking. The second issue is that
      since Rage only lasts a minute, you need to be sure the fight is either your last before resting or
      going to extend longer than 4 turns to get enough value out of Rage.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Combo 3 - Prepared Bear</b>: Your wildshape Can last a long time, half your Druid level in hours!
      That means it’s not a bad idea to wildshape the moment you find a dungeon or think combat is going to
      happen soon. Even better is if you got an easy use of wildshape earlier and still have plenty of hit
      points left over. That means you can rage your first turn and attack, the idea situation. The only
      risks involved are about wildshaping too early then not having combat until after your form fades
      away. This can also be an issue if your party needs you to cast a spell, communicate, or perform a
      skill check your wildshape can’t do, forcing you to revert before you got value out of it.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Extra Combo - Rage Healing</b>: One important thing to consider is that Rage can halve the damage
      of certain attacks. This means that against some opponents you health is effectively doubled, expanded
      to nearly all enemies if you dip an extra level of barbarian for totem warrior. This also means
      healing is twice as useful. An often neglected feature of Moon Druid's "Combat Wild Shape" feature is
      that you can spend a spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points per spell slot level. When combined with Rage,
      that means you can spend a 2nd level spell slot to heal 2d8 damage as a bonus action, but the enemy
      must DEAL 4d8 damage to undo this healing. This creates another valuable way to use your spell slots
      in some situations.</li>
  </ul>

  <div id="Wildshapes-Guide">
    <h2> Wildshapes Guide </h2>
    <p>
      Guidelines: High HP, High STR, high CON is good as it may allow for an AC
        while in the wildshape which is higher than it's natural armor, due to the
        Barbarian's "Unarmored Defense" perk.

  <p>Like all good builds, there are many variants that people have invented. The following are such
    variants:
  </p>
  <h3><span id="Smite_Bear:_Barbarian_3/Paladin_2/Druid_15"></span><span
      id="Smite_Bear:_Barbarian_3.2FPaladin_2.2FDruid_15">Smite Bear: Barbarian 3/Paladin 2/Druid

        title="Edit section: Smite Bear: Barbarian 3/Paladin 2/Druid 15">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
  <p>One thing that can be somewhat frustrating for players using this build is that so much of their power
    is tied to spells rather than their Raging animal form. This build solves that by using Divine Smite to
    convert that stored power into damage that can be added onto melee attacks. With a combination of that
    and healing from Combat Wildshape, you can fully unlock a new level of power for your character,
    something that only gets better as the campaign goes on rather than falling off like other versions.
  </p>
  <p><b>Leveling guide</b>
  </p>
  <p><b>Mechanics</b>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Divine Smite, Rage and Wildshape can be used together thanks to their wording. All three are
      considered "Class Features", meaning that restrictions that prepent the use of spells don't limit them
      (Rage and Wild Shape specifically). Wildshape also allows you to retain your class and racial
      features, meaning that all of these opitons remain available to you for the duration.</li>
    <li>Divine Smite says that "when you hit a creature with a <i>melee weapon attack</i>, you can expend
      one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the <i>weapon’s</i> damage".
      Beasts attacks are all called "melee weapon attacks". In addition, they are a special catagory called
      "Natural Weapons", discussed by DnD's designer Jeremy Crawford in a <a rel="nofollow"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKLx-BVnsmo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=WL&amp;t=380">Sage
        Advice Video</a></li>
    <li>Armor Class can be increased through Barbarian's Unarmored Defense and Shield Proficiency. Unarmored
      defense often has a higher AC with your wildshapes stats then their natural armor. Also, since you
      maintain proficiencies when you wildshape, you can wield a shield if your form has the appropriate
      limbs. By loosening the straps of the shield before hand, your wildshape bear can get an easy +2 AC.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This build also focuses on progression, making sure if you play a character with this you can enjoy
    EVERY level, not just level 20.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Level 5: All core mechanic are unlocked - Rage, Wildshape, and Divine Smite. You can experience this
      build's core concept at this level.</li>
    <li>Level 10: Totem Warrior is quickly rushed to avoid being outpaced by Monsters progressively higher
      damage. Unlock higher spell slots as well.</li>
    <li>Level 15: Earth Elemental wildform is unlocked for what is often the final encounter. Divine Smite
      is maxed out and still have extra spell slots.</li>
    <li>Level 20: You can use two 5 CR beasts rather than one 5 CR elemental now. Your a potent spell caster
      if you choose, but no 9th level spells.</li>
  </ul>
